Coding Minecraft (Alpha)
========================
Use command blocks
-------------------
Make a few functionalities with command blocks and edit mobs has always been difficult. This project trys to simplify all the prosses to allow all the map makers make more awesome maps faster.

It uses the different command blocks introduced in the snapshots for Minecraft 1.9 and uses a few tricks to allow big conditional blocks (and subconditional ones).

Simple
-------
Make a new Project and add a new Codding or Entity sheet. Drag the blocks and double click them to edit its properties.

If you are making an Entity, multiple blocks represents that they are ridding each other (the top one is the top of the entity [the one you summon/spawn]).

If you are making a Codding sheet, the flow goes from top to bottom and if is inside another block it means i is conditional to that (blocks that allow conditionals are bigger). 

Web application
---------------
I choose it to be a web application becouse it's multiplatform and with the tools given I can still do it easily; even have the offline version (using appcache), load and save files, generate files, allow to export to .schematic file, etc.

Still in Alpha
--------------
It doesn't even work yet. I'm currentlly working to make it possible.
